## The Control Unit ##

The main methodology behind my CU design was to make the '.sv' files readbable and easy to debug. This would allow my team members to quickly interpret and thus inform their own design choices when they depended upon control signals from the CU.

The component design was split into **2 seperate modules**:

1. The Main Decoder
2. The ALU Decoder
